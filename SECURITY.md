# Security Policy
As Scanly is an open-source project, you are more than welcome to inspect the code for security issues. As well as this, you are able to run any security test against your **own downloaded local copy** of Scanly. **Note** this does not give you permission in any way to attack the Scanly website, or abuse the demo robot on the site. If you do, you may face legal consequences from us and our infrastructure providers.

If you do find an issue, please contact us using the following [contact form](/contact/), and we will try to answer you as soon as possible. If you wish to **encrypt your message**, which would be greatly appreciated, please view our [PGP key](/.well-known/pgpKey.txt).

In acknowledgement of any security issues found, we will list your name in the credit section of our site!
